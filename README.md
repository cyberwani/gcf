# Gutenberg Custom Fields

Gutenberg Custom Fields allows you to control the content of the Gutenberg edit screen by creating pre-filled templates.

Navigate to the "GCF" admin page, create a new template, select a post type and add fields as you wish.

The Gutenberg Editor will be pre-filled with the corresponding post type's template.
